Whilst I hope to eventually have a full markdown document available to take you through this package, for the moment you'll have to make to with the "JSAM_Walkthrough.R" script you can find in the main repository.

Please note that the MDB_Data file is not freely available, though you can email me to request it. I should have a simulation file up shortly to allow you to simulate date for use.
